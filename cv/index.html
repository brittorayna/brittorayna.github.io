        <p>My name is Rayna Britto and I am an undergraduate student at the University of Georgia studying computer science. Through my internship with Quilly, I was able to work on the development side of the app and was consistently coming up with new ideas on how to enhance our product. Working on finding new ways to innovate product and having to conduct lots of market research and competitor analysis has created a passion for me in product management and development. I enjoy researching and finding creative ways to improve different products. I am now working with a start-up called Dressy Club, an app that allows college students to rent out their clothes to other students, and I am working on the product through database analysis and am tasked with coming up with new ideas that make the app easier to use but also can bring in features that are able to be monetized. I enjoy working with a team as it helps brainstorm new ideas in an agile environment. My position as a lead student consultant at the University of Georgia's EITS Technology Lending program has helped me develop skills where I am able to be of service to students who are interested in renting out our various technology as well as overseeing a team of 20 other undergraduate employees to whom I serve as a point of contact for any help needed. Working in this position has given me the confidence to manage a team and improved my problem solving skills. My goal post-graduation is to work in product management. </p>
