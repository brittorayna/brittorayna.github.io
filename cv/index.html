        <p>My name is Rayna Britto and I am an undergraduate student at the University of Georgia studying computer science. I currently work as a lead student consultant at the EITS Technology Lending Program and as a product development intern with Dressy Club. As a product intern, I analyze user interactions with our app, particularly evaluating the usability of newly implemented features. I also work closely with our product managers and software engineers to brainstorm and develop innovative solutions that enhance the overall app experience. My previous experience includes working with UGA’s student-led agency, where I partnered with real clients to help achieve their objectives. This experience has given me valuable insights into business models and stakeholder management. I am adept at navigating both Agile and Waterfall methodologies in team environments and excel at delivering solutions in fast-paced, analytical settings.</p>
